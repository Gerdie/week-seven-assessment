Recursion

In your own words, what is recursion?

Recursion is a programming strategy in which a function can call itself, and thus
repeat the same operation on a new, presumably related input. It is especially 
useful in situations like traversing a graph.

Why is it necessary to have a base case?

If there is no base case, the function could continue to call itself forever (or
at least until Python shuts it down).

Graphs

What is a graph?

A graph is a structure for organizing data. Trees and linked lists are types of graphs.

How is a graph different from a tree?

A graph can have cycles; trees are acyclic. Nodes/Vertices in a graph can have multiple parents;
in a tree, each node has <= 1 parent. 

Give an example of something that would be good to model with a graph.

Connections on LinkedIn. Every person is a Node/Vertex, and each Edge is labeled with "Coworker"
or "Friend" or "Relative" or however the people know each other.
